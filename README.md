Cipheive is an enhanced version of the classic Caesar Cipher. It uses a 5-digit key to cyclically shift each letter of the input text, providing a more secure encryption method than the traditional single-number Caesar Cipher. This project allows both encryption and decryption using a dynamic, multi-digit key system.

##Description
Cipheive is an implementation of a substitution cipher with multiple shifts, designed to improve the security of simple encryption. Instead of a fixed key, the project generates a 5-digit key, which is applied cyclically to the input text, making the cipher more robust.
