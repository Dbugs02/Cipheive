# Ciphive
 Ciphive is an enhanced version of the classic Caesar Cipher. It uses a 5-digit key to cyclically shift each letter of the input text, providing a more secure encryption method than the traditional single-number Caesar Cipher. This project allows both encryption and decryption using a dynamic, multi-digit key system.
